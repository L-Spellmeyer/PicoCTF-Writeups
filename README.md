# PicoCTF-Writeups

### Project Description:
<p>
My name is Levi Spellmeyer and this is my repository focused on the writeups from my completed ctfs provided by picoCTF. Each folder represents an individual challenge and within the folder 2 files can be found:
</p>
<br>
1.   A file containing notes on my thought process, steps I took to solve the challenge, notable commands/code, and my key takeaways from the challenge
<br>
<br>
2.  A file containing a summary and solution of the specified challenge. This document will be created by using my file of notes and prompts given to generative ai to help me practice working with generative ai and recieving desired outputs. I will also give credit or mention the generative ai used.
